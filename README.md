# SpaceInvaders
Space invaders using typescript

## Introduction
This project uses Reactive Javascript to create the classic arcade game Space Invaders.
The emphasis is towards using Functional programming paradigms which involve state management
rather than procedural/OOP concepts. 


## Run
Require node.js. 
1) Run command "npm install typescript" at the directory level during first time. Only needed to do it once.
2) Run command "npm run build" to transpile the Typescript to Javascript.
3) Open the spaceinvaders.html file in the browser to play. Recommended to use google chrome.
